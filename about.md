Hi, my name is Nick.

I am a current MS student in statistics at Oregon State University.
Before that, I worked for a few years and before that I went to Rutgers University for my BA.
In addition to studying, I also teach at OSU as a TA which I actually really enjoy.

My academic interests are pretty applied.
My statistical interests are in bioinformatics, statistical genomics, and spatial statistics.
I mainly do work in R, but I'm also really into GNU/Linux and other terminal stuff, especially Vim and shell scripting.
I'm also trying to brush up on my Python skills, specifically for data science and scientific computing.
Last year (2019), I read [this](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Misc/PBM.html?fbclid=IwAR0Ey-7tzhJSeDwgHaZbDC73Pxo-8JaC3VA5_f884cYfxGZ_CwfHH_UwaZY) and it left a weirdly profound impact on me.

Other than that, I play guitar, do general exercise things, or drink beer when I need to not stare at a computer.

Here is a picture of me in case you were wondering.
