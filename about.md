Hi, my name is Nick.

I am a current **MSc student in statistics at Oregon State University**.
Before that, I worked for a few years in a tech startup and before that I went to Rutgers University for my BA.
In addition to studying, I also teach at OSU as a TA which I really enjoy.

My academic work is pretty applied.
My research interests are in bioinformatics, statistical genomics, statistical computing, and spatial statistics.
I mainly do work in R, but I'm also really into GNU/Linux (especially Vim) and system administration.
I'm also trying to brush up on my Python skills, specifically for data science and scientific computing.

Last year (2019), I read [this](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Misc/PBM.html?fbclid=IwAR0Ey-7tzhJSeDwgHaZbDC73Pxo-8JaC3VA5_f884cYfxGZ_CwfHH_UwaZY) and it left a weirdly profound impact on me.

When I'm not looking at a computer, I play guitar and while I do exercise regularly, I don't actually play any sports.
I do watch a lot of sports though, especially college football (Go RU).

Here is a picture of me in case you were wondering.
