Hi, my name is Nick.

I graduated with my MSc in statistics from Oregon State University in June 2020.
Before that, I went to Rutgers University for my BA and worked for a few years in a tech startup.
In addition to studying, I also taught at OSU as a TA which I really enjoyed.

My academic work is pretty applied.
My research interests are in statistical computing, spatial statistics, and biostatistics.
I mainly do work in R, but I'm also really into GNU/Linux (especially Vim) and system administration.
I'm also trying to brush up on my Python skills, specifically for data science and scientific computing.

Last year (2019), I read [this](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Misc/PBM.html?fbclid=IwAR0Ey-7tzhJSeDwgHaZbDC73Pxo-8JaC3VA5_f884cYfxGZ_CwfHH_UwaZY) and it left a weirdly profound impact on me.

When I'm not looking at a computer, I play guitar.
I have weeks of regular exercise interspersed with months of indolence.
While I don't actually play any sports, I do watch a lot of college football and baseball.

Here is an intentionally pretentious picture of me.
