# Uhh

I just thought that this [rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H110vCGvTmM&t=172s) should be written down somewhere so people can read it without having to go to a Flat Earth convention.

<center>
Earth is flat jack flatter than a flapjack<br>
we bout to flat smack globers getcha backpacks<br>
I'm with my flat pack globes in the trash sack<br>
As I move an equidistant map up on my snapback<br>
Flat smackin everybody at joe's crab shack<br>
Lookin at us like what we're saying is so abstract<br>
Lesson 1 no curvature there to be found<br>
How can it be a ball if nothing about it is round<br>
Lesson 2 three quarters of the ground <br>
is covered in flat water do you hear the way that sounds<br>
Lesson 3 take the stars that you see at night<br>
same constellations that you've been seeing for all your life<br>
Never trust NASA cause nothing they say is right<br>
They're lying to your face and they mock us in plane sight<br>
You can straight up see the wires and the green screen glitches<br>
and the water bubbles floating on the space walk missions<br>
It's detestable I refuse to be another vegetable<br>
Pseudoscience garbage will to me be unacceptable<br>
Anyone with eyes to see don't have to be susceptible<br>
Dispose of your globe in the nearest waste receptacle<br>

we backpackin you already know<br>

再见<br>
до свидания
